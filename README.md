# Digital Warranty Tracker 🛠️📑

## 📌 What is it?

The **Digital Warranty Tracker** is a blockchain-based smart contract that brings **transparency and trust** to warranty management.

Manufacturers or sellers can register products on-chain, linking them with their **purchase date** and **warranty expiry**. Customers can then file claims directly through the contract. Claims are only valid if submitted **before the warranty expiration**, ensuring no fraudulent or backdated claims.

This solution eliminates paperwork, automates verification, and creates an **immutable record** of warranty coverage.

## 💡 Why build this?     
 
### 1. Eliminates Fraudulent Claims 

Traditional warranty systems rely on invoices or paper-based proofs, which can be forged or manipulated. On-chain records ensure that claims are valid only during the defined warranty period.

### 2. Trust Between Buyer & Seller

Both manufacturers and customers can check warranty validity transparently. This reduces disputes and builds long-term trust.

### 3. Automation & Efficiency

Instead of manual validation, the contract automatically verifies warranty status and claim eligibility, saving time and resources.

### 4. Tamper-Proof Records

Once registered, warranty data (purchase date, expiry date, product details) cannot be altered by either party. This creates a **single source of truth**.

### 5. Ownership Flexibility

Products can be associated with customer addresses. If ownership changes (e.g., resale), the warranty record is still traceable on-chain.

### 6. Real-World Applications

- Electronics & Appliances ⚡
- Automobiles 🚗
- Industrial Machinery ⚙️
- Consumer Goods 🛒
- Mobile Phones & Gadgets 📱

## ⚙️ How it works

1. **Admin (Manufacturer/Seller)**

   - Registers a product with warranty details (duration, serial number, owner).
   - Can extend warranties (e.g., for promotions or service plans).
   - Approves or rejects claims filed by customers.

2. **Customer (Product Owner)**

   - Can check warranty status anytime.
   - Files a claim if the product has an active warranty.

3. **Smart Contract Logic**
   - Checks claim validity based on expiry date.
   - Prevents multiple simultaneous claims for the same product.
   - Maintains immutable records of all claims and warranty periods.
